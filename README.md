#The Sudoku
<p>To calculate time complexity between different solving algorithms.</p>
<p>This program is able to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Generate sudoku with different difficulty levels</li>
<li>Solve the sudoku puzzle with solving algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>Algorithms used: </p>
<ul>
<li>Backtracking</li>
<li>Constraint propogation w/Backtracking</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: </p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize constraint propogation algorithm...seriously</li>
<li>Create an interface for both the solving algorithms (Currently they are seperate files that don't link with each another</li>
</ul>
